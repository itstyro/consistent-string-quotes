<h4>The module consistent-string-quotes makes the string representation consistent throughout the javascript files in a project.</h4>

<b>What it does ?</b>

<b>Prerequisites:</b><br/>

2) Run 'npm install' in the root directory<br/>
<br/>
<b>Configuration:</b><br/>
1) Use properties.ini file to configure the project
