The module consistent-string-quotes makes the string representation consistent throughout the javascript files in a project. 



What it does ?

if you don't have identical representation for string literals in javascript files that is somewhere you used "" (double quotes) and somewhere '' (single quotes) to specify a string. Then it helps you to make this consistent.
